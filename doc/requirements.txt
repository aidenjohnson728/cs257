Teammates: Alden Harcourt and Aiden Johnson

Our dataset compiles all ultimate frisbee games played in the 2025 USAU D1 and D3 regular seasons (no postseason games are in the dataset). 
This dataset includes the two teams that played each other and their respective points by the end of the game. 
The dataset also details what tournament the game was played at and the game’s date. 
This dataset was acquired via email exchange with the owner of the site frisbee-rankings.com (who also coaches Cal-Poly Slo).
