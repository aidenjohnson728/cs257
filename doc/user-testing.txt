User Testing Observations

Things the testers found easy
- Navigating seamlessly through the pages was not challenge. As in, going from one place to the other was never tricky.
- Navigating each page had simple and intuitive instructions that everyone was able to do successfully.
- Reading the data presented was never a challenge for anyone after general explanation.

Things people had trouble with
- Every person lacked a concrete understanding of what our algorithms did. Explanation is necessary.
- The home page was a bit confusing for many testers. 
- Some users needed follow up explanation on what a page was doing at first. 
- Drop down menus were unclear sometimes, users could not correctly click on them sometimes. 

Other positive comments or observations
- All of the functionality of our code worked exactly as we wanted. Now the only thing is finetuning 
our web application's UI. 
- People really liked the layout of our web app.
- My Team Is Better Than Your Team was a function everyone enjoyed playing around with. 
- People thought our app was cool! 

Other suggestions for improvement
- We should add a search bar to the teams page. 
- Working on the drop down menu for our MTIBTYT page. We need to connect the drop down menu to the search. 
- We want this team list and leaderboard to look coherent and as part of the same whole.
- User Interphase tweaks as mentioned above.
